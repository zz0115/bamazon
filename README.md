Welcome to the BAmazon App!

There are two types of users for the app:
1. Customer
2. Manager

Type 1: If you are a customer, you can view what we have on BAmazon and choose the product and the quantity you want to purchase, then we will tell you your total purchase price.

For example, if the customer want to buy 100 ThermoPro, then the total price will be $949. The stock quantity for ThermoPro in the database will increase by 100.

If the quantity the customer wants to buy exceeds the stock quantity, the app will tell the customer there's insufficient quantity.
